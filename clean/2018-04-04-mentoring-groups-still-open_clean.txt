“MENTORING GROUPS OPEN FOR MULTIPLE TIMEZONES”


NA

Did you miss the deadline to join a mentoring group? Do not fear, there
are still openings for mentees to join groups in the following
timezones:

-   UTC+2
-   UTC+1
-   UTC+8
-   UTC+11

To join, fill out this application.

Mentoring groups are beneficial to participants because group members
are able to focus on specific goals, including teaching their first
workshop and developing new lesson contribution material. Being a part
of a group that addresses something important to you is both powerful
and enjoyable. You do not want to miss out on the Carpentries mentoring
opportunities. Join a mentoring group today!

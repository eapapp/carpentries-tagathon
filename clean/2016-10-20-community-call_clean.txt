“COMMUNITY CALL ON ASSESSMENT”


Discussion of our workshop survey results"

Dr. Kari L. Jordan, Data Carpentry’s Deputy Director of Assessment, will
be speaking on the Community Call on the impact our workshops have on
our learners. Kari will cover the results of our post-workshop surveys
including learner attitudes, learner data management and analysis skills
prior to and following our workshops, and learner attitudes toward Data
Carpentry instructors. Come and hear about our successes and share your
thoughts. It’s going to be an informative community call!

Can’t make the call? The Data Carpentry Assessment Report is online too
and available on our Assessment page.

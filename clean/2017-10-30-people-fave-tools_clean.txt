“PEOPLE’S FAVOURITE TOOLS”


NA

A big thank you to everyone who has responded so far to the call for
short posts about their favourite tools.

So far we have had Paula Martinez on R, Jeff Oliver sharing his love of
Git and GitHub, Kellie Ottoboni talking up IPython, and Thomas Arildsen
on how the Jupyter Notebook facilitates his teaching. Juliane Schneider
has now weighed in on the wonders of OpenRefine.

Expect more posts as people contribute further favourites. Even if your
tool has already been mentioned, we would still welcome a post about it,
as your use of the tool may be different.

Have you got a favourite tool you would like to tell us about? Please
use this form to add a bit of detail and we will do the rest. You can
read the background to these posts here.

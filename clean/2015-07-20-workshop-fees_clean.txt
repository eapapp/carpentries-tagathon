DATA CARPENTRY WORKSHOP FEES


Workshop fees to increase for workshops scheduled after September 1, 2015 to help

After discussion with our Steering Committee and the Software Carpentry
Foundation, we have decided to increase our workshop coordination fee in
order to better reflect the real cost of our staff’s time, our overheads
and the value of the training. This is part of our broader efforts to
make sure that Data Carpentry provides the best training possible and is
sustainable long into the future.

Like Software Carpentry, if a workshop is requested after September 1,
2015, the fee will be $2500 per workshop for universities and
non-profits. We will continue to respond to requests for waivers from
organizations that would otherwise not be able to afford a workshop.

We are also in the process of developing an affiliate/partner program so
that in the future it will be possible to reduce the cost of individual
workshops by partnering with us directly*.

If you are interested in hosting a workshop, please fill out the form at
http://datacarpentry.org/workshop-request.html and don’t hesitate to get
in touch at info@datacarpentry.org if you have any questions.

-   Note that SCF discounts do not apply to Data Carpentry workshops

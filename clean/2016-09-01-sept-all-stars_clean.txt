“SEPTEMBER DATA CARPENTRY ALL-STARS!”


Recognizing volunteers for their outstanding work in the community."

As a community-led organization, Data Carpentry depends on our active
and highly-engaged volunteer community to carry out many of our core
activities. Volunteer efforts span a wide range of activities, including
teaching workshops, developing and maintaining lessons, and training and
mentoring new instructors, among many other efforts. Without the
commitment of our volunteers, Data Carpentry would never be able to
reach such a broad learner base and to make such a huge impact on our
learners.

We’d like to make it a habit to actively recognize and publicly
acknowledge the great work that is being done by members of our
community. Because there are so many ways to contribute to Data
Carpentry, we’d like to focus each month on a different way that our
volunteers are making an impact. This month, we’d like to start out by
showcasing the efforts of our most active instructors.

Every one of these Data Carpentry badged instructors has taught at least
three workshops since January 2016, including at least one Data
Carpentry workshop. Many are also actively involved in serving the
Carpentry community in other ways.

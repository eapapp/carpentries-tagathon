“WELCOME TO NEW TRAINERS”


NA

We are excited to welcome seventeen newly badged Trainers to our
community. The group recently finished their program with Karen Word and
are now certified to teach new Carpentry Instructors.

Join us in welcoming Tania Allard, Anne C. Axel, Mik Black, Murray
Cadzow, Mesfin Diro, Caroline Fadeke Ajilogba, Anne Fouilloux, Alejandra
Gonzalez-Beltran, Claire Hardgrove, Toby Hodges, SherAaron Hurt, Senzo
Mpungose, David Perez-Suarez, Juliane Schneider, Nicholas Tierney,
Jessica Upani, Elizabeth Williams.

This was a very widely distributed group, so congratulations to the
group and to Karen for making the training work across a challenging
number of time zones.

Instructor training in New Zealand will get a boost with the addition of
Mik and Murray. Adding Claire and Nicholas has doubled Trainer numbers
in Australia. Expansion of Carpentries activity throughout Africa will
accelerate with the addition of new Trainers Caroline, Senzo, Mesfin,
and Jessica. Senzo and Caroline have already co-instructed with Erin
Becker and Martin Dreyer at this workshop. The revival of the African
Task Force should also spark an uptick in activity across the African
continent. Alejandra, David, and Tania will also help build our Spanish
language representation as we expand into Central and South America.

We look forward to many upcoming opportunities to teach with our new
Trainer cohort!

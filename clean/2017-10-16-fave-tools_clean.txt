“BLOGGING FOR THE CARPENTRIES - WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU”


Share your knowledge to help others work more efficiently"

This is an open invitation to our community members to share their
knowledge.

We have a global community working in many different disciplines using a
vast range of tools. On our blog, we would like to tap into that
community experience and then share that hard-won knowledge.

This kind of information could help people new to a discipline, or might
inspire others to try out a tool they have never used before.

Time wasted or time saved?

As with all learning, there is an opportunity cost; time spent learning
new tools is time stolen from essential research.

So the first decision might be whether you can spare the time to learn
something new, though that might not be the hardest decision. After all,
if a tool pays off in increased efficiency and time savings down the
track, then that time is definitely well spent.

But _which_ tool should you pick? For _what_ purpose?

This is where experience in a discipline is so valuable. After all,
anyone working with statistics can probably make a great case for R.

We would like to hear from community members willing to share their
experiences.

Posts on _My Workflow_ from senior researchers in a discipline would be
a fantastic resource for newcomers.

Posts about _My Favorite Tool and Why I Love it_ would help others
decide whether to put in the time to master it.

You may be thinking “I am _way_, _way_ too busy” to do this so we want
to make it easy for you. We have a form with some prompts for you to
fill in. Just a few short lines are all we need, and we will do the
rest.

Worried you have made errors in the form after submitting it? Anxious
you have omitted something important? We will let you review the post
before it goes out.

So what are you waiting for? Please tell us your story today!

*[When did you realize you belonged to the Carpentry community?][belonging]*

My first encounter with the Carpentry community was early in my PhD training,
*way back when* Software Carpentry was teaching programming lessons using
[brilliantly narrated videos][swc-shell-video]. I knew then that a basic
understanding of computer programming was an important part of a strong career
in science. What I didn't expect was to get inspired by a community of
scientists and teachers that promotes openness and collaboration throughout
their work. 

Fast forward to the present... having just accepted my first faculty position
in agroecology (read, big data scientist in agriculture), I am very glad that I
got involved in the Carpentry community. The Carpentries active and open
approach to science and teaching has become my own.

I taught laboratory courses throughout my PhD and quickly realized that the
Carpentry model of active-learning resonated with my preference for teaching
labs. There is something about engaging students in the learning process and
giving them an opportunity to explore the lesson material. Insightfully, the
Carpentry community elevated this active-learning process to include their
instructors who are empowered to contribute to the [collaborative development of
open source lesson materials][collaborative-dev]. For new instructors and 
veteran Carpentry community members alike, now's an exciting time to be
involved.

Data Carpentry is working to expand their collaborative workshop development to
include curriculum innovation for college and university courses
and just formally [announced the first semester-long Data Carpentry Course][fork-our-course].
It doesn't take much to get involved. Instructors and students are encouraged to
[provide feedback][feedback-contribute] for the course to help improve the content and clarity of the existing curriculum. Instructors are also welcome to
[fork the course][fork-our-course] and use the general site structure and
templates to develop their own course and expand the domains represented by the
Carpentry community resources. 

To get the collaborative course development rolling, instructors are encouraged
to [contribute][feedback-contribute] exercises and lessons that can be used to
customize the existing course structure to specific needs of various classes and
programs. We use a ['reverse instructional design'][lesson-training] to develop
our course materials and the exercises are the heart of that approach. Strong
exercises clearly direct the instructional materials to be presented, facilitate 
practice of the material, and assess learning.

The Carpentry community continues to grow and we are excited for your
participation. Let us know how we can help you get involved.

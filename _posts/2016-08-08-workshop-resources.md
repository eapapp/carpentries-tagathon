A successful Data Carpentry workshop is the result of coordinated effort among many different types of participants, including instructors, helpers, hosts, learners and Data Carpentry staff. Data Carpentry offers two types of workshops - self-organized and centrally-organized. These workshop types differ in terms of instructor training requirements, fee structures, and participant responsibilities - with local hosts and instructors at self-organized workshops taking on administrative responsibilities normally handled by Data Carpentry staff.  

Instructors (both new and experienced) and workshop hosts often have questions about their roles in workshops logistics, especially with how their responsibilities differ between self-organized and centrally-organized workshops. To help clarify the roles played by the different participants, and the differences between self- and centrally-organized workshops, we've put together some resources to guide participants through the workshop organizational process.  

These resources are available on our ["Host a Workshop"](/workshops-host/) and ["Self-organized Workshops"](/self-organized-workshops/) pages and include:  

- Checklists for:  
    - [instructors](/instructor-checklist/)  
    - [hosts for centrally-organized workshops](/host-checklist/)
    - [hosts/lead instructors for self-organized workshops](/self-org-lead/) 
    - and [lead instructors for centrally-organized workshops](/hosted-lead/)  
- [Email templates](/email-templates/) for communicating with co-instructors, helpers and learners  
- An [accessibility](/accessibility/) checklist  
- A list of necessary [equipment](/equipment-checklist/) and  
- A [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) page  

We want these resources to be as useful as possible to our instructor, helper and workshop host community. If you find that anything is unclear, incomplete, or would like to suggest an additional resource, please [email us](mailto:ebecker@datacarpentry.org) (ebecker@datacarpentry.org).

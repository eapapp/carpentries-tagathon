The first inaugural [CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) is less than 50 days away! The taskforce is diligently working to make sure all t’s are crossed and I’s are dotted to ensure that the Community enjoys a wonderful un-conference. While doing so, we have realized that we need one more thing…**YOU**!!!

Have you had a desire to get involved with the planning of CarpentryCon and did not have the time? Or maybe, you felt as though you did not know where you could be most valued? Or maybe, you thought the taskforce had everything under control and did not need your help?

If you had any of those thoughts, I’m happy to tell you those are all misconceptions. While the planning is well underway, there are areas that can use a few additional hands. And we would  **LOVE** for you to get involved! You may only be able to assist for an hour, a day or possibly the entire conference. It does not matter the amount of time, if you want to help, there will be something that could use your assistance!

Here are areas that could use YOU!
- *Pre-Conference Setup*
- *Registration*
- *Speakers and Workshops*
- *Social Media*
- *AV*
- *Entertainment*

There are awesome benefits to becoming a volunteer. Here are just a few:

- Making an impact on The Carpentries community
- Network with The Carpentries community
- Discounted items
- Free items

CarpentryCon will be a history making event for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). We would like for as many of 
our community members to be a part of this great event. If you would like to get involved,
please send an email [carpentrycon@carpentries.org](mailto:carpentrycon@carpentries.org) to receive more information.

We look forward to seeing you in Dublin, Ireland!

All of the great work that we do as The Carpentries is dependent on
the hard work and creativity of our community of volunteers. Each of
you plays a vital role in helping us fulfill our mission of spreading 
data skills and computational literacy to researchers and other
professionals worldwide. Within our Carpentry community, there are
a number of subcommunities of like-minded folks carrying out 
particular aspects of the Carpentry mission. This blog post is the
first in a series focusing on one of our sub-communities - the 
Maintainers.

All Carpentry lessons are kept up-to-date and functional by a small
group of Maintainers. Maintainers review pull requests and issues
to their lesson repositories and also engage with the community about
the overall goals and direction of their lesson. In the last months
of 2017, I engaged the Maintainer group in a set of individual 
conversations to understand the issues facing the Maintainer
community as we grow and to develop an action plan to help this group
best move forward their important work. 

Through this process, I had the opportunity to talk individually with
nearly half (46%) of current Maintainers. The emergent themes from 
these conversations are detailed in the [Carpentry Maintainer Interviews - 2017 Report]({{ site.urlimg }}blog/Report-maintainer-interviews-2017-public-version.pdf) and include:

- Aspects of the Maintainer experience that people enjoy are the opportunity to shape the lesson, to interact with the community, the chance to learn new things, and the ability to have a larger impact.  
- Major issues that Maintainers experience are a sense of being overwhelmed, wanting more guidance and help, clarity about their roles and authority, and overall negative feelings about their level of involvement in their lessons.  
- Many Maintainers expressed interest in being more active in the community and getting to know their co-Maintainers better.   

I've really appreciated the opportunity to talk individually with 
members of the Maintainer community and understand the issues they 
face. Based on these conversations, there are five action items in
progress to help resolve the issues identified. 

1) Changing to an application model for recruiting new Maintainers: To reduce feelings of guilt and pressure to be a Maintainer, we are changing to an application-based model for recruting new Maintainers.   
2) Recruiting new Maintainers: In November, The Carpentries put out a call for new Maintainers to join the Maintainer team. There were 23 applicants, of whom 22 were invited to join Maintainer onboarding. Fifteen of these new Maintainers finished onboarding last week.    
3) Providing training for new Maintainers: A [pilot curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/) for onboarding new Maintainers is in use with the new Maintainers. Contributions are welcome!  
4) Facilitating interactions among Maintainers: Monthly meetings for the Maintainers community have been scheduled and are advertised on the community calendar and [Maintainer Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/maintainers).  
5) Rethinking the Instructor checkout process: Feedback on proposed changes to the Instructor checkout process has been requested from the Maintainers and Trainers groups and any changes will be implemented in the next months.  

I truly appreciate the candor of all those who have shared their 
experiences with being a Maintainer. Understanding the difficulties 
we face as a community is a necessary first step to resolving these
issues. Please join me in enthusiastically thanking the Maintainers 
for all of the work that they do in keeping our lessons and workshops
running smoothly!

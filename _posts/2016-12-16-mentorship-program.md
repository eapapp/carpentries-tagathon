The Carpentry community is growing quickly! Over a hundred new instructors have been trained in the past two months. 
These new instructors join our community because they’re excited to help fellow researchers who are struggling to analyze their data and 
because they share our commitment to reproducibility and open access. In spite of these shared values, however, **[a third of our 
instructors never go on to teach with us.](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/instructor-metrics/)**     

The Carpentry community has a strong tradition of supporting our instructors. We hold weekly live discussion sessions where those who are 
new to our community can benefit from the collective wisdom of more experienced instructors. However, we know that it helps to get some 
more support when starting out as an instructor. We as a community can mentor and provide that support to help the Carpentry community 
stay strong as we continue to grow.   

Data Carpentry, in collaboration with the Data/Software Carpentry mentoring committee is piloting a Mentorship Program in the new year. This program will support 
instructors who are new to our community by matching them with a personal Mentor - instructors who have volunteered their time to help 
new instructors gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills they need to successfully certify as an instructor and teach 
their first workshop.   

We invite anyone who is interested to attend an information session. Whether you’re an instructor who wants to help your fellow 
instructors prepare to teach their first workshop, or a new instructor who would like some guidance - please come learn more about 
the program and share your thoughts about how we can best support our new instructors become active members of our community.   

Please sign up on the meeting Etherpad:

If you’re interested in the program but can’t attend any of the listed times, please contact
